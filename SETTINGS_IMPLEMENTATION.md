# Settings Implementation

## What I Fixed

Your DayDrain app now has a **fully functional Settings window**! ðŸŽ‰

### Changes Made:

1. **MenuBarController.swift**
   - Added `settingsWindow` property to manage the settings window
   - Implemented `openSettings()` method that creates and displays an NSWindow with the SettingsView
   - The window is persistent (not released when closed) so settings are retained

2. **SettingsView.swift**
   - Upgraded to a **TabView** with two tabs:
     - **General Tab**: Configure your work schedule
     - **About Tab**: App information and version
   - Improved sizing (500x400 instead of 360 fixed)
   - Better visual layout with sections and proper spacing

## How to Use

### Opening Settings:
1. Click the DayDrain icon in your menu bar
2. Select "Settingsâ€¦" (or press âŒ˜,)
3. The Settings window will open

### Settings Options:

#### General Tab:
- **Workdays**: Toggle which days of the week you work
- **Working Hours**: Set your start and end times
- **Display Mode**: Choose how remaining time is shown:
  - Percentage
  - Hours left
  - Hours & minutes left

#### About Tab:
- App name and version
- Brief description

### Features:
âœ… Window position is saved automatically (setFrameAutosaveName)
âœ… Settings persist across app launches (via DayManager's UserDefaults)
âœ… Window can be minimized, closed, and reopened
âœ… Settings update in real-time
âœ… The menu bar icon updates immediately when you change settings

## Testing

To test the settings:
1. **Build and Run** the app in Xcode (âŒ˜+R)
2. Look for the progress bar in your **menu bar** (top right area)
3. **Right-click** (or left-click) the menu bar icon
4. Select **"Settingsâ€¦"**
5. Try changing:
   - Work hours
   - Work days
   - Display format
6. Close the settings window
7. Hover over the menu bar icon to see the updated tooltip

## Technical Details

The settings window uses:
- **NSWindow** with NSHostingController to embed SwiftUI
- **@ObservedObject** binding to DayManager for reactive updates
- **TabView** for organized settings sections
- **Form** with sections for clean layout
- Native macOS styling and controls

Enjoy your fully functional settings! ðŸš€
